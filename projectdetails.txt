Track/Topic : Finance/Beginners Hack | Budget Boss

Slogan: Retire effortlessly with Budget Boss

Prompt: Bugdeting website that tracks financial decisions for a planned amount of time. Uses Ai backend to 
compute the budgeting for clients. Ex| Income, montly spending budget, savings etc. In general, a website to 
plan savings into returement or for any future financial expenses, etc.

Demo: We show how it works on the website and input our montly income, expenses, and outputs the potential
savings. Bonus, if time permits we can add a economy budgeting plan where we offer a minimalist spending list 
to maximize savings without breaking bank with our AI BudgetBoss, which has the domain name under GoDaddy Domain, budget.boss.
It should be accessible mainly on desktop, but it can be accessible on a mobile web browser.

The AI backend should be intelligent enough to create full plans for those that are uninformed about financial decisions,
and there could be multiple options to allow for you to manually input data if you would like to.

Demo Website Details:
- Minimalistic Background (Ie Blank white slate or black slate)
- Client input box for financials for backend to compute
- Outputs will be below the client input box
- Bonus, mode select on the website like how AI models can be switched. 

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
